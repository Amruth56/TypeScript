    TypeScript makes our code easier to read, write and maintain

    TypeScript catches errors at compile time instead of runtime, which makes debugging easier and reduces the likelihood of bugs in production 

    A browser wont support TypeScript, we have to transcribe the code into js in order for the browser to understand.
